# Astro 497 Lab 3

## Exercise 1:  Model Building I 
- Work through ex1.jl  (a Pluto notebook)

## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Fit a linear model to data

Students will strengthen their understanding of: 
- Analyzing transit observations
- Direct fitting of general linear models via linear algebra
- Limitations of linear models
- Loss function surface for linear models
- Model fitting via optimization of loss function
- Checking for convergence of optimization algorithm
